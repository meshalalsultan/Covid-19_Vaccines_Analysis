# Covid-19 Vaccines Analysis

## Overview
This project delves into the analysis of Covid-19 vaccination data across different countries. Utilizing Python, the analysis covers vaccination progress and compares vaccine manufacturers to provide insights into global vaccination trends.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Includes data on vaccination by country and manufacturer.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform statistical analysis to understand vaccine distribution and effectiveness.

## Project Structure
- **country_vaccinations.csv**: Data on vaccinations per country.
- **country_vaccinations_by_manufacturer.csv**: Data on vaccinations sorted by manufacturer.
- **covied.py**: Python script for data analysis.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/meshalalsultan/Covid-19_Vaccines_Analysis.git
    ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn  # Assuming these are used
    ```
3. **Run the analysis**:
    ```bash
    python covied.py
    ```

## How It Works
The Python script reads the vaccination data, processes it to derive insights such as vaccination rates, and outputs visualizations comparing the effectiveness and distribution of vaccines by different manufacturers.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the analysis or extend the dataset are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your updates.
